## The Zen of Python

### Beautiful is better than ugly.
### Explicit is better than implicit.
### Simple is better than complex.
### Complex is better than complicated.
### Flat is better than nested.
### Sparse is better than dense.
### Readability counts.
### Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
### Although practicality beats purity.
### Errors should never pass silently.
### Unless explicitly silenced.
### In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
### There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
### Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
### Now is better than never.
### Although never is often better than right now.
### If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
### If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
### Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
