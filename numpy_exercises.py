insert numpy as np 

a = np.array([4, 10, 12, 23, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, -6, 3, -7])

# 1 How many negative numbers are there?

# 2 How many positive numbers are there?

# 3 How many even positive numbers are there?

# 4 If you were to add 3 to each data point, how many positive numbers would there be?

# 5 If you squared each number, what would the new mean and standard deviation be?

# 6 A common statistical operation on a dataset is centering. 
# This means to adjust the data such that the mean of the data is 0. 
# This is done by subtracting the mean from each data point. Center the data set.

# 7 Calculate the z-score for each data point. Recall that the z-score is given by:
